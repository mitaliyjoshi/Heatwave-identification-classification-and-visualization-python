This code can detect, classify, and visualize heatwaves considering the thresholds based on percentiles of daily mean temperature distribution over past years (Ouzeau et al., 2016). Here, we develop the code by Machard et al. (2022) further by introducing stripes visualising the average annual summer temperature. We also add a possibility for comparing heatwaves for two or more cities. Additionally, with this code, you can visualise and compare the intense heatwaves for the cities in a country/region on a map. The code is easy to use for beginners and professionals working with heatwaves. The code can directly produce graphs and information indicating the heatwaves and comparing it for two or more cities.
